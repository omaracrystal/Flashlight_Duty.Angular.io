#1 N.io
- fix lag time - only works at http not https - after being deployed / chatroom breaks at http but works at https
- nio pop up is disrupted by correct answer in chat room

#2 Extra
- create practice area

# Stretch Ideas
- only have one user in control of flashlight in chatroom
- have the ability to switch off duty from flashlight
- track data through mongoDB (login/logout/resister)
- profile page
- once nio is created - have a dice that can be rolled via mobile shakes... also have a version of the dice on the page
